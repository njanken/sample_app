<p>The <strong>Ruby on Rails Tutorial, 2nd Edition</strong> book and screencast series teach you how to <span class="highlight">develop and deploy real, industrial-strength web applications</span> with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, the open-source web framework that powers top websites such as <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://hulu.com/">Hulu</a>, <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>, and the <a href="http://yp.com">Yellow Pages</a>. The <a href="/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> book</a> is <a href="/book">available for free online</a> and is <a href="#buy">available for purchase as an ebook</a> (PDF, EPUB, and MOBI formats). The companion 2nd edition screencast series includes <span class="highlight">11&nbsp;individual lessons totaling more than 15&nbsp;hours</span>, with one lesson for each chapter of the <a href="/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> book</a>. The best value is the <a href="#bundle">ebook/screencast bundle</a>, which includes <span class="highlight">more than 500 pages of total content and more than 15 hours of video</span>.</p>

<br />

<p>The Rails Tutorial screencasts contain dozens of tips and tricks to help you <span class="highlight">go beyond the <em>Rails Tutorial</em> book</span>, including debugging hints, test-driven development techniques, and solutions to many of the book&rsquo;s exercises  (<a href="http://youtu.be/bOdn9EdUquo" target="_blank">view a sample video</a> or some <a href="#free_screencasts">free screencasts</a>). And though the screencasts are carefully edited, I&rsquo;ve left in some of the problems I encountered along the way, so that you can <span class="highlight">learn how to recover from the inevitable application errors</span>&mdash;and see that even experts sometimes make mistakes.</p>

<p id="prerequisites"><em>Prerequisites</em>: Because web applications are by nature complex, some background in programming is recommended. Familiarity with Ruby is useful but not strictly required; I recommend following the short interactive tutorial at <a href="http://tryruby.org/">Try Ruby</a>. You can also do the free tutorial at <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombies</a> to get a taste of what Rails can do. For more information, see the section <a href="/book#sec:comments_for_various_readers"><em>Comments for various readers</em></a> in the Rails Tutorial book.</p>


<p>The <a href="/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> helps you <span class="highlight">learn Rails by example</span> through the development of a substantial sample application, including a site layout, a user data model, a full registration and authentication system, user-micropost associations, social "following", and a feed of status updates. The <a href="/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> also teaches good software development practices, including <span class="highlight">version control</span> with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <span class="highlight">test-driven development (TDD)</span> with <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a>, and <span class="highlight">instant deployment</span> with <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. Though of necessity the book and screencasts focus on a specific sample application, the emphasis throughout the <a href="/">Rails Tutorial</a> is on general principles, so you will have a solid foundation no matter what kind of web application you want to build.</p>

  <h2 class="product title">An absolutely top-notch package for learning the Rails 3 framework</h2>
  <blockquote class="round">

<p>Written and presented by theoretical physicist Michael Hartl, <a href="/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> offers <strong>a&nbsp;superb introduction to the world of a Rails developer</strong>. The Rails Tutorial PDF and complete training video set is an absolutely top-notch package for learning the Rails 3 framework&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough how much I enjoyed the Ruby on Rails Tutorial book+video bundle</strong>. <a href="railstutorial.org">railstutorial.org</a> will no doubt educate legions of beginning and intermediate Rails developers, and will be one of those resources that students who complete the book and video course will refer to often. Because Michael offers the full contents of the book available for free on the website, both the book and videos are sure to become some of the most frequently cited educational references among Rails 3 students. This package will no doubt play a major catalytic role in many Rails technical training and development careers.</p>

<p>If you have any interest in Rails 3, <strong>you owe it to yourself and your educational investment to obtain this superb package</strong>. It will likely be one of the best and most educationally rewarding purchases you will make this year.</p>

    <h4>These screencasts are awesome</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I got review access to all of the material a week ago and can confirm that, yes, these <a href="/screencasts">screencasts</a> are awesome (as long as watching over 15 hours of screencasts is your cup of tea). I've seen people compare them to the style used by Ryan Bates on his <a href="http://railscasts.com/">Railscasts</a> and I'd go along with that. Direct and practical&hellip;</p>
      <p>If you basically want to be able to look "over the shoulder" of an experienced Rails developer and see how a Rails development environment is set up and how multiple apps are built, there's nothing that can beat this. This isn't a set of "build a blog in 15 minutes" videos&mdash;it's a complete course that could kick off a new career for you with Rails&nbsp;3.0.</p>

    <h4>A great encore by a master teacher</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Michael Hartl has followed his tour-de-force <a href="/book">Ruby on Rails Tutorial book</a> with an equally accessible and effective set of video screencasts. Both the book and the screencasts are great standalone introductions to the world of Ruby on Rails&nbsp;3.0, but using the two in combination or in tandem is even better in granting confidence of mastery of this difficult subject.</p>
      <p>I particularly enjoyed the "you are there", watching-the-sausage-being-made style of presentation. Typos, syntax errors, and blind alleys are all there as would occur in real-life programming. This approach does several things&mdash;it adds drama (you can't wait to see if it works), it gives the viewer reassurance that your own failings are within normal limits, and finally it's instructive in how to approach the Rails debugging process itself.</p>

    <h4>Something you just can't get as well from a book</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Michael's screencasts are more in the style of <a href="http://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> than of <a href="http://peepcode.com/">PeepCode</a> or <a href="http://railscasts.com/">Railscasts</a>, which is to say it's pretty much just Michael and his laptop screen, walking your fingers around a keyboard as you build and deploy a Twitter clone complete with tests and a solid user interface.  Michael is the sort of teacher who can make an idea clear in 15 minutes, when another teacher might need an hour&mdash;or worse, when another teacher might put you to sleep.</p>
      <p>Even if you're the sort of person who learns best on her own, from a book&mdash;and I fit this profile&mdash;I still recommend the screencasts.  Michael's passion for his subject is both obvious, and infectious, and by watching the screencasts you'll get an idea of how a solid Rails developer thinks about building production quality applications&mdash;something you just can't get as well from a book.</p>

    <h4>The new screencast series got me to a whole other level of understanding</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Michael's original <a href="/book">Ruby on Rails tutorial</a> got me from someone who read Rails books to someone who actually was able to develop basic Rails apps&mdash;his teaching methodology somehow got me involved like no other book and allowed me to produce results quickly and gain confidence. The new screencast series got me to a whole other level of understanding.</p>
      <p>Imagine going through the tutorial but having the pro-level developer behind the tutorial giving you a running commentary with tips, tricks, and useful detours&mdash;all while contributing to your growth as a Rails developer with a test-driven approach. I've always known that understanding how experts think about what they do is the key to learning and mastering something. In this screencast format, Michael was able to go beyond the limitations of the written word and both show and explain his approach to Rails development in an engaging manner.</p>

    <h4>The equivalent of a packed 2 or 3 day Rails course at a bargain price</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The <a href="/book"><em>Rails Tutorial</em> book</a> is currently the best way to get from zero to 60 with Rails&nbsp;3, but with the screencast series it's like going from zero to 100 at the same time. It adds a whole other dimension to the same material by making it become so much more alive. Having Michael's screen and voice guide me through the lessons was such a breeze and added value by providing hands-on practical information while at the same time the PDF was there as a reference. Truly a winning combination in the equivalent of a packed 2 or 3 day Rails course at a bargain price in the comfort of my own home!</p>

    <h4>The #1 place to start when learning Rails 3</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial book is the #1 (and only, in my opinion) place to start when it comes to books about <em>learning</em> Rails&nbsp;3. Not only is it available to read for free online, but you can buy a well-formatted PDF too. It's an amazing piece of work and, unusually, walks you through building a Rails app from start to finish with <em>testing</em>. If you want to read just one book/site and feel like a Rails&nbsp;3 master by the end of it, pick <a href="/">RailsTutorial.org</a>.</p>

    <h4>Ruby on Rails Tutorial is the best!</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Just wanted to say that your Ruby on Rails tutorial is the best!</p>
      <p>I've been trying for awhile to wrap my head around Rails. Going  through your tutorial, I'm finally feeling comfortable in the Rails environment. Your pedagogical style of gradually introducing more complex topics while at the same time giving the reader the instant gratification and a sense of accomplishment with working examples really works for me. I also like the tips and suggestions that gives me a sense of learning from a real Rails insider. Your e-mail response to a problem I ran into is an example of your generous sharing of your experience.</p>

    <h4>Woohoo! This is some fun coding with RoR&hellip;</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I have done other books (including RailsSpace), and none make the intro to RoR so much fun as this one.</p>
      <p>Given that I have read other RoR books, I did not expect to learn new stuff just going through the first couple of chapters. Just expected the same-ole 'Hello, world!' stuff. BUT NONE OF THAT WAS THERE&hellip; and I DID learn new stuff I did not know:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to use Git properly</li>
        <li>How to <a href="http://heroku.com/">deploy Rails the easy way</a></li>
        <li>Neat TDD tricks which make test-driven development fun</li>
        <li>and so much more&hellip;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All within the first 3 chapters. I already feel like a better developer ;-). Now, I expect we are going to be getting started heavy with the sample app in <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/rails-flavored-ruby#top">Chapter 4</a> [and beyond].</p>

    <h4>Very detailed and hands-on Rails tutorial!</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Hi Michael, great job! I'm learning Rails, and I found your tutorial to be one of the most detailed and hands-on guides. Besides many details of Rails, it also taught me about Git, Heroku, RSpec, Webrat, and most important (at least to me) it emphasized the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. I learned a lot from your tutorial.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This is the best introduction to Rails I've ever seen. Rails is amazing, but with the fast-moving pace of the tools the community uses, I've always felt like it was some sort of exclusive club I couldn't get into. But after going through just the first chapter and having a Rails app up and running using Git, with a GitHub repo and deployed on Heroku, I don't feel left out anymore.</p>
      <p>Keep up the amazing work!</p>

    <h4>Impressive</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Sometimes I feel the text is too long and I think it is all clear on the page, before I even read it. Sometimes I stumble a little and may even re-read a paragraph or two, figuring out what I missed. But in the end of the chapter I feel I grasped everything, can do the exercises easily, and know where to look for the answer.</p>
      <p>I honestly think the book is tremendously effective in making Ruby on Rails even more popular and in making programming so much fun!</p>

    <h4>Great Explanation of Version Control, Hosting and Testing</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I've read a number of Rails books and this one (finally) made me understand it. What made it great was the inclusion, right off the bat, of Git, GitHub, Heroku, and RSpec. Version control, hosting and testing are usually topics kicked to the back of the book and BORING. You made it exciting&mdash;I cheered as my first Autospec test passed in the background after I made a change to the code. When I do move on to more customizable and scalable databases and hosting systems, I'll be ready. Also, <a href="/book#top">Chapters 1&ndash;4</a> offer a great basic template for setting up almost any site.</p>
